### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/news-summarizer.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Get an API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and add it to a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   VITE_NEWSAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Now the app will use their own API key for local development.
